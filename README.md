## Obsidian Text-to-Speech Plugin

Just select the text you want the plugin to read and click the speaker icon in the ribbon bar (shortcut Ctrl + L). You can adjust the reading speed and pitch from the settings tab.
Plugin uses the voices that you have installed on your system. To install new voices on Windows 10 go to "Change text-to-speech settings".
After you have installed new voices restart the app to see them in the settings menu. (If still not visible close and reopen the settings window)
For other operating systems search "how to add text-to-speech voice to chromium on Linux/MacOS etc." (I will add more information later)
